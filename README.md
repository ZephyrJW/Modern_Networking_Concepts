Assignment_1:
Chatting Application. 
Applied TCP/IP protocol and socket programming.
Up to 5 machines connected, one acts as server, the others act as users.

Assignment_2:
Implemented basic functionality and logic of three reliable data trasport protocols:
Alternating Bit(ABT), GoBackN(GBN), and SelectiveRepeat(SR).
Compare performance and expected behavior as in the report.

Assignment_3:
Implemented Distance Vector Routing algorithm.
Applied both UDP and TCP protocol, socket programming, network encoding, etc..
Build routing table among 5 machines with UDP, keep updating in case of failure or route weight changes, also implemented file transfer utility via TCP connections.
